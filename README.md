# Learn to Code

#### web form to determine where to begin coding

#### By _**Casey Idsinga**_

## Description

This is a basic web form using branching to suggest what coding language to start learning.  

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* load page on preferred browser
* select options from dropdown menus
* submit

## Known Bugs

Page loads with question mark behind the address indicating that the form is auto submitting.  JS includes event.preventDefault command but still getting this message.

Page can be used by deleting the question mark at the end of the address.

Also, while not a bug, I'm not completely happy with the Submit button layout but can't get it to do what I want.
